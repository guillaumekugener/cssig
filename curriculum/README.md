# Coding Workshop Curriculum

All these Courses come from the same HarvardX Data Science program. If you have experience beyond these courses, please email us individually. We recommend completing the Courses in the following order:

1. Data Science: R Basics
   - https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics
   - This course will introduce you to the basics of R programming. 
<br />

2. Data Science: Visualization
   - https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-wrangling
   - Manipulating data to create tables and variables for your specific analysis is one of the things that makes R so much more useful over spreadsheets (like Excel and Google Sheets). This course will teach you how to efficiently sort through your data preprocessing - a crucial step before you can do any downstream analysis.
<br />

3. Data Science: Wrangling
   - https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-wrangling
   - Manipulating data to create tables and variables for your specific analysis is one of the things that makes R so much more useful over spreadsheets (like Excel and Google Sheets). This course will teach you how to efficiently sort through your data preprocessing - a crucial step before you can do any downstream analysis.
<br />

4. Data Science: Data Productivity Tools
   - https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-productivity-tools
   - As you write more and more code, you’ll want tools to manage all of the files that you create. Or you might want to be able to look at the version of a file that you created several months ago. This course will give you an understanding of the best practices to version control your files and how to organize larger scale analysis projects.
<br />

5. Data Science: Linear Regression
   - https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-linear-regression
   - One of the main reasons people use R is to do data analysis and statistical computing. Linear regression is one of the most basic “machine-learning” models that you can use to analyze your data. It’s a fancy way of saying “what is the best fit line for my data.” Once you have practiced the other aspects of R (basics, plotting, wrangling), I would highly suggest taking this course to learn how you can begin building predictive models.
