- The tutorial has some extra information and may seem a little confusing at first. But as you continue on with this course, you’ll slowly be able to understand it and apply this to your own projects!

Survival analysis is an important method of data analysis that allows you to analyze and predict the duration of time until an “event” happens. This is mostly used to study the survival rates of patients after they receive a certain treatment.

This is useful for any research where you are collecting data about a treatment or intervention and you are trying to understand how the treatment affects survival rates, disease recurrence rates, or any sort of measurable “event.” 

For example:
- Survival rates after cancer treatment.
- Time from first heart attack to the second.
- Rate of AIDS development after HIV diagnosis.

This is an important model to be able to create if you are doing any sort of research regarding clinical trials.
