# MCSIG

Welcome to the Medical Computer Science Interest Group's GitHub!
 
MCSIG's mission is to teach programming skills to medical students for use in medicine, medical research, and clinical projects. Our goal is for our members to acquire a valuable new skill that they can utilize immediately and will benefit them in their future careers.

Throughout the year, we plan on holding weekly Coding Workshops where we will guide you through edX Courses about the basics of Programming in R. We will supplement this course with medically and research relevant exercises that you can apply to your own projects and research. 

This GitHub repository stores the code that we use for our demonstrations/exercises. Feel free to use this repository for reference if you are interested in generating similar figures or if you would like to review what we covered in our sessions.
