The Medical Computer Science Interest Group (MCSIG) is a SIG dedicated to teaching medical students programming skills for use in research and clinical medicine. Throughout the year, we plan on holding workshops where we will guide our peers through edX courses on the basics of programming in R. We will supplement this course with hands-on, medically relevant examples for you to apply what youâ€™ve learned from the workshops. Our hope is that everyone that attends will leave having acquired a new skill that they can immediately apply to research or clinical projects!

This github repository stores the code that we use for demos for our workshops. Feel free to use this repository for reference if you are interested in generating similar figures or if you would like to review what we covered in our sessions.
